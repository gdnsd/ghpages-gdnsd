<p>If you're not on this list and want to be, please drop a line!  I know I've talked to people deploying gdnsd at various other companies in the past (and some have even provided patches!), mostly CDN providers, but I'm not going to assume you want to be listed here unless you've already mentioned it publicly elsewhere.</p>

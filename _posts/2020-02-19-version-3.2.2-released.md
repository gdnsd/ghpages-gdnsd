    3.2.2 - 2020-02-19
        * Bugfix: In the case that a "replace" daemon takeover happened while
          unexpired ephemeral ACME challenge data was present (which is handed
          off to the new replacement daemon), the new daemon could pause for the
          entire value of "acme_challenge_ttl" (default: 10 minutes) during its
          startup sequence.  The takeover/replace process would eventually succeed
          between the two daemons, but the long wait would cause various timeouts
          for control/notification by default (e.g. gdnsdctl won't wait that long
          to report the success).

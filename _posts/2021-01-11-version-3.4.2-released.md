    3.4.2 - 2021-01-11
        * Several bugfixes are included here which came to light while reworking
          major chunks of the code in a 4.x prototype branch.  All are also
          backported to the 3.[23].x branches for packagers.
        * Fixed a few memory leaks that can happen in certain uncommon zonefile
          parsing failures related to TXT data, CAA data, and/or the zone
          filename itself
        * Fixed some missed response packet compression opportunities when the
          query name from the client was not already normalized to lower case.
        * Fixed some log message output bugs when complaining about SOA records
        * Added missing min_ttl/max_ttl clamping to RFC 3597 records' TTLs.
        * Fixed a corner case that could cause mixed TTLs in a single rrset, in
          the case of ACME challenges defined for the same name both statically
          in zone data and via gdnsdctl.
        * Fixed a bug which could force an RR's TTL to the value "1" if it were
          outside the range declared by ttl_min and ttl_max (default 5 and
          3600000) and the non-default "zones_strict_data" (or -S flag) was
          enabled.
        * Configurations of plugins and zone data which allow DYNC to return
          address (A/AAAA) records are deprecated.  They still work, but they
          emit a log warning message every time a zone is loaded which creates
          such a situation.

    3.1.0 - 2019-03-30
        * RFC 8490 "DNS Stateful Operations" (DSO) implemented and enabled by
          default for all TCP listeners.  Can be disabled in case of interop or
          other issues via the new global config option "disable_tcp_dso".
        * Zonefile parsing can now use multiple threads for speed.  There's a new
          config option "zones_rfc1035_threads" (default: 2) to specify how many
          threads to use when parsing zones on start or reload.  You'll have to do
          some testing to find an optimal value for your setup.
        * TCP control sockets: you can now define a limited-functionality TCP
          control socket listener which gdnsdctl can connect to from another
          machine.  See the documentation for the new config option "tcp_control".
        * experimental_no_chain config option: As the name implies, this is for
          experimentation only.  If set to true, gdnsd will never chain through
          zone-local CNAME entries while generating responses, instead emitting
          just a singular CNAME RR.  See the documentation for more details!
        * Some substantial internal refactoring was done for code cleanliness and
          for making runtime queries more CPU/cache-efficient.

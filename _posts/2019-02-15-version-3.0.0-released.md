    3.0.0 - 2019-02-15
        * Note that this is a major version number bump, and for some users and
          configurations this means major compatibility-breaking changes.  Do not
          expect a simple upgrade like a minor version release!  Please see the
          separate file VERSION3.md which offers an overview of all the major
          changes from 2.x; there's too much to succinctly summarize here.
        * Also, all previous NEWS entries were shifted to NEWS.old, so that we can
          start this file over and leave previous 2146 lines of updates behind.
        * For beta users: there were no functional changes since the final
          2.99.9950-beta release, only QA/refactoring work and a couple of
          FreeBSD-specific fixups to the TCP parts of the testsuite.

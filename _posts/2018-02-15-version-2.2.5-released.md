    2.2.5 - 2018-02-15
        * GeoIP2: Detect coordinate-free post-2018 GeoLite2-City databases, and
          refuse to use them with auto_dc_coords. cf:
          https://blog.maxmind.com/2018/01/02/discontinuation-of-the-geolite-legacy-databases/
        * GeoIP2: fixed the handling of automatic, coordinate-based mapping for
          networks with no coordinates (e.g. anon-proxy, satellite).  These now
          return the default datacenter ordering as documented, which is how GeoIP1
          has always behaved.  The GeoIP2 code was calculating distances for these
          networks based on literal 0,0 coordinates since the code was introduced.
        * Fixed zonefile comment parsing for RFC 3597 RRs
        * Removed illegal malloc function attributes (could cause optimizer bugs?
          no known reports)
        * Removed useless/invalid syslog.target dependency from systemd unit
        * Fix testsuite breakage with system Net::DNS
        * Various minor docs / logs / error message / spelling fixups

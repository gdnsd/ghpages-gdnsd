    3.0.1 - 2019-03-04
        * Bugfixes:
          * The code which validates that loaded zonefile RRs are not oversized for
            implementation limits (~16KB encoded response data per RR Set) was
            having its results thrown away, nullifying the validation.  Now the
            limit is checked properly, and zonefiles containing such data will be
            rejected at load time.
          * Minor fix for UDP error statistics, in a corner case on platforms that
            do not have the recvmmsg()/sendmmsg() syscalls, where sometimes what
            should've incremented the UDP "recvfail" stat instead incremented the
            "dropped" stat.
          * Daemon no longer exits with an error if asked for resource states info
            over the control socket ("gdnsdctl states") when no such states are
            configured at all.
          * Removed redundant and outdated help string for "-i" from gdnsdctl's
            usage output.

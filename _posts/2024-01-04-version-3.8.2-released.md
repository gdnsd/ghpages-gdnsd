    3.8.2 - 2024-01-04
        * Fixed testsuite compatibility with Net::DNS 1.39 and higher.
        * Fixed "gdnsd daemonize" (was universally broken in 3.8.1)
        * Fixed an unlikely race in the daemon replacement sequence, which under
          systemd may have caused the replacement to be flagged as an alien main
          PID, with varying consequences depending on the systemd version (in
          recent ones, just a harmless error message apparently)
        * Fixed another process mgmt issue that caused a ~15s delay near the end
          of the daemon's clean shutdown, iff extmon monitoring is used.
        * Fixed a small memory leak that happens if a file parsed by the extfile
          plugin has bad syntax
        * extfile also no longer pointlessly loads or parses files which are not
          actually used to control any resource
        * Several minor QA tooling updates, and several minor QA-driven patches
          of little consequence (e.g. constification, simplifications for
          analysis, etc)

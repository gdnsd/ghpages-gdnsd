    2.2.4 - 2016-04-14
        * libmaxminddb 1.2.0+ compatibility, using the new interface.
        * Note that libmaxminddb's 1.2.0 release is a shared library runtime
          compatibility barrier for gdnsd; compiling gdnsd against <1.2.0 and
          running against >= 1.2.0 (or vice-versa) is not supported, and the
          daemon will exit with an error message indicating this if it happens.
          For distributions, you may simply want to make 1.2.0 a required
          minimum for gdnsd going forward.  This situation is unfortunate, but
          there's no clean way to avoid it given upstream broke the undocumented
          (but only!) database iteration interface's assumptions in 1.1.5, then
          broke them again in 1.2.0 while introducing the new interface.

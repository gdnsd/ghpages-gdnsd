    2.4.1 - 2019-01-10
        * These two fixes are backports from master branch work towards 3.x:
        * Reverted the detection and rejection of post-2018 GeoLite2-City databases
          with auto_dc_coords that was added in 2.3.1, as MaxMind later reversed
          course and decided to keep the coordinates in the databases.
        * Bugfix for a bad printf() format specifier in the case that strerror()
          failed on non-GNU platforms.

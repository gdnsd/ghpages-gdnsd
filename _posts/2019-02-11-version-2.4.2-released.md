    2.4.2 - 2019-02-11
        * FreeBSD: Fix EADDRNOTAVAIL issue for IPv6 sockets when the listening IP
          is bound to the loopback and traffic is routed indirectly, by resetting
          ifindex to zero for non-link-local IPv6 IPs in the cmsg structure passed
          between recvmsg() and sendmsg().

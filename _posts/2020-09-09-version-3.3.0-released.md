    3.3.0 - 2020-09-09
        * New Feature: 'skip_first' flag added for geoip resource definitions.
          This allows defining a backup geoip resource which shares the same map as
          a primary resource, but always resolves to the second-best choice for a
          given client, as if the (dynamic) first choice were down.

    3.5.0 - 2021-01-11
        * Multiple efficiency improvements for TCP conn handling, primarily aimed
          at reducing the per-conn memory footprint and malloc churn.
        * Address (A/AAAA) records are now properly randomly shuffled each time
          they're emitted in responses.  Previously we were doing a basic rotation
          of them in the supplied order.  Shuffling has better load distribution
          characteristics in some scenarios.
        * NS responses now include true glue, when warranted, for qtype=NS at the
          root of a zone.  This covers some important corner cases, including the
          root-of-dns delegated glue hints case.  Previously, we were only
          attempting to attach glue to delegation responses, but never zone root
          qtype=NS responses.

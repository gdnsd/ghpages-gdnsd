    2.4.0 - 2018-02-15
        * plugin_multifo: added "ignore_health" parameter. If "ignore_health" is
          true, all addresses are added to the result set regardless of health, but
          the up_thresh and TTL effects still happen, and the final resource-level
          state still reflects the overall state as it would without
          "ignore_health", for meta-plugin consumption.

    3.6.0 - 2021-02-24
        * UDP DNS threads now idle much more efficiently when there's little to no
          network traffic arriving for them.  Previously all such threads woke up
          and re-executed recvmsg() at least once every ~3.1 seconds.  Now they
          block indefinitely in a ppoll() call once they've been idle for ~257ms or
          longer.  This reduces thread wakeup churn and thus power/cpu efficiency
          waste in the case of unused threads for extra listen addresses.  It also
          reduces the worst corner case for daemon shutdown delays caused by UDP
          threads from ~3.1s to ~257ms.
        * TCP DNS threads now invoke rcu_quiescent_state() more often, which
          can help data reloads complete faster when there are many active TCP
          clients per thread.  Previously they quiesced or went offline from RCU
          once per eventloop iteration, where one iteration could handle up to 1
          pending request per client connection for many connections.  Now they
          also quiesce once for each response sent.
        * SO_REUSEPORT_LB is now used for better UDP and TCP socket loadbalancing
          on BSDs which have this socket option available.
        * Zone and config files are now loaded more efficiently when there are many
          small ones, by switching to a malloc()+read() pattern instead of mmap()
          for files that are smaller than 1MB.  mmap modifies process-global memory
          mappings once per file, which is expensive for a multi-threaded daemon
          loading many small files (especially in parallel!), so it's just not
          worth it unless the files are large-ish.

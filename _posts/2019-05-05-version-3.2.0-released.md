    3.2.0 - 2019-05-05
        * ACME challenge response TXT RRs are now emitted with a TTL of zero by
          default, which makes things work reliably in some tricky corner cases
          with ACME providers.  This can be overridden via the new config option
          "acme_challenge_dns_ttl".
        * The minimum configurable value for "min_ttl" was reduced from 1 to 0.
        * The "min_ttl" setting now correctly clamps small TTLs for SOA records.
        * All out of zone glue addresses (truly out of zone, not just within a
          local delegation) now generate a warning on zonefile loading (or an error
          if zones_strict_data is in effect).  Support for out of zone glue will
          likely be removed in a future major version bump, as it's basically
          useless and non-recommended in the DNS in general at this point in
          history, and supporting it is needlessly complicated.
        * Minor refactorings, nit-fixes, and docs updates.

    3.5.1 - 2021-02-10
        * [Fixes marked with [BP] are also backported to 3.[234].x branches for
          convenience, but new releases from those branches are not imminent]
        * Fixed issue #202, which was causing non-ANY UDPv4 listen sockets to fail
          to work correctly on FreeBSD 12.2 due to some new strictness in its
          parsing of sendmsg() msg_hdr contents since sometime after 12.0. [BP]
        * Fixed a bug which may have caused issues listening on global unicast
          UDPv6 addresses bound to loopback interfaces on some platforms.  This
          was previously fixed for just FreeBSD in 2.4.2 and 3.0.0.  The existing
          fix was just extended to all other platforms, as it probably should've
          been the first time around. [BP]
        * Fixed a bug that was causing escape sequences for binary bytes in
          domainnames to be emitted incorrectly in log message outputs. [BP]
        * A workaround was added for building on platforms which lack
          MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC for SCM_RIGHTS socket handoff.
        * Some fatal error message outputs in the case of a failed "replace"
          operation were cleaned up for consistency.
        * A new configure argument "--with-buildinfo=FOO" was added so that
          packagers can build with a consistent version output encoded in the
          binary regardless of whether they're building directly from git.
        * Some docs, comments, and log message typos fixed by lintian
        * A few small code QA nits of no real consequence

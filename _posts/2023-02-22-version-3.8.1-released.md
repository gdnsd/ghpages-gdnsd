    3.8.1 - 2023-02-22
        * Fixed several obscure and unlikely bugs which could be triggered when
          there's a failure to launch a replacement daemon.  There were two
          distinct classes of issue here: some of the bugs could cause undefined
          behavior in the parent daemon due to unsafe logging calls in a forked
          subprocess alongside the threaded parent, and the others could cause
          the original daemon to safely exit with an error when it could and
          should have merely logged about it and continued running.  Either way,
          all of these bugs were only triggerable by a real operational issue
          preventing the successful launch of a replacement daemon in the first
          place (e.g. resource exhaustion or a missing daemon binary)
        * Testsuite updated for compatibility with newer versions of Net::DNS
          up through 1.36 (thanks paravoid!)
        * A bunch of minor QA updates to catch up with changes in online
          and local QA tools, compilers, distros, etc.   These are to clear up
          some warnings and/or build issues, none of which should make any
          functional difference at runtime.  These include fixes for Github
          issues #220 and #230 .

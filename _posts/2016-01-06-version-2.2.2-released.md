    2.2.2 - 2016-01-06
      *** Bugs fixed:
        * Fixed a bug (introduced in 2.2.1) in HTTP monitoring when using the
          "vhost" parameter.
        * The code now falls back from F_OFD_SETLK to F_SETLK at runtime if the
          runtime environment differs from the compile-time one.
        * Changed the binary "Build Info" string to make the build
          reproducible (do not include e.g. host or date information).
        * Several updates to qa scripts/tools to keep up with recent changes
        * A few trivial warning/analysis cleanups that should be no-op
